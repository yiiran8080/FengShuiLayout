# React Infinite Re-render Loop Fix

## Issue

The application was experiencing a "Too many re-renders" error in the `EnhancedCoupleSpecificProblemSolution` component.

## Root Cause

The infinite re-render loop was caused by calling `setState` functions inside a `useMemo` hook:

```javascript
const compatibilityScore = useMemo(() => {
	setScoreCalculationCount((prev) => prev + 1); // ❌ Causes re-render
	// ... other code ...
	setStableScore(calculatedScore); // ❌ Causes re-render
	return calculatedScore;
}, [dependencies]);
```

### Why This Caused Infinite Loop:

1. `useMemo` runs during the render phase
2. Calling `setState` during render triggers another render
3. This creates an infinite loop: Render → setState → Re-render → setState → Re-render...

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed setState Calls from useMemo

**Before:**

```javascript
const compatibilityScore = useMemo(() => {
	setScoreCalculationCount((prev) => prev + 1);
	// ... calculation logic ...
	setStableScore(calculatedScore);
	return calculatedScore;
}, [dependencies]);
```

**After:**

```javascript
const compatibilityScore = useMemo(() => {
	// Removed setState call to prevent infinite re-render loop
	// ... calculation logic only ...
	return calculatedScore || 75;
}, [femaleUser, maleUser, contextAnalysisData, stableScore]);
```

### 2. Moved State Updates to useEffect

Added a separate `useEffect` to handle score locking outside the render cycle:

```javascript
// Lock the score when first calculated (using useEffect to avoid re-render loop)
useEffect(() => {
	if (
		stableScore === null &&
		compatibilityScore !== null &&
		compatibilityScore !== 75
	) {
		console.log(
			"🔒 EnhancedCoupleSpecificProblemSolution - LOCKING score to prevent changes:",
			compatibilityScore
		);
		setStableScore(compatibilityScore);
	}
}, [compatibilityScore, stableScore]);
```

### 3. Cleaned Up Unused State

Removed unnecessary `scoreCalculationCount` state variable that was only used for debugging.

## Key React Principles Applied

1. **No side effects in render**: Never call `setState` during the render phase (inside `useMemo`, render function body, etc.)
2. **Use useEffect for side effects**: State updates should happen in `useEffect` hooks
3. **Proper dependency arrays**: Ensure dependency arrays include all variables used in the hook

## Expected Result

- ✅ No more infinite re-render loops
- ✅ Compatibility scores still calculated correctly
- ✅ Score locking functionality preserved
- ✅ Proper synchronization between components maintained

## Testing Completed

- Component loads without errors
- Compatibility circles display stable scores
- No console errors related to re-renders
- Functionality remains intact
