# Compatibility Score Stabilization Fix

**Issue**: The compatibility circle in `EnhancedCoupleSpecificProblemSolution` was changing values multiple times (72 ‚Üí 80 ‚Üí 82 ‚Üí 78 ‚Üí 82) while `CoupleAnnualAnalysis` remained stable at 82.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Multiple API Calls**: The `CoupleAnalysisContext` was making multiple API calls to `/api/couple-analysis` with different session IDs each time it re-rendered
2. **Dynamic Session IDs**: Using `Date.now()` created new session IDs on every render, causing fresh API calls
3. **Score Variation**: Each AI response from DeepSeek returned slightly different compatibility scores due to the inherent randomness in AI generation
4. **Real-time Updates**: The `EnhancedCoupleSpecificProblemSolution` component was recalculating its score every time the context data changed

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Stable Session ID in CoupleAnalysisContext

**File**: `/src/contexts/CoupleAnalysisContext.jsx`

- **Before**: `sessionId: 'couple-analysis-${Date.now()}'`
- **After**: Stable session ID based on user birth dates
- **Benefits**: Prevents multiple API calls for the same couple data

```javascript
const stableSessionId =
	user1?.birthDateTime && user2?.birthDateTime
		? `couple-analysis-${user1.birthDateTime.replace(/[^0-9]/g, "")}-${user2.birthDateTime.replace(/[^0-9]/g, "")}`
		: `couple-analysis-${Date.now()}`;
```

### 2. API Call Prevention System

**File**: `/src/contexts/CoupleAnalysisContext.jsx`

- Added `apiCallMade` state to prevent duplicate API calls
- Added logging to track when API calls are made vs. skipped
- Reset flag only on explicit refetch or error

```javascript
const [apiCallMade, setApiCallMade] = useState(false);

if (apiCallMade) {
	console.log("‚ö†Ô∏è API call already made for this session, skipping...");
	setLoading(false);
	return;
}
```

### 3. Score Locking Mechanism

**File**: `/src/components/EnhancedCoupleSpecificProblemSolution.jsx`

- Implemented score locking to prevent changes after first calculation
- Added calculation counter for debugging
- Once a score is determined, it's locked and won't change

```javascript
const [stableScore, setStableScore] = useState(null);

// PRIORITY 0: If we already have a stable score, use it to prevent changes
if (stableScore !== null) {
	console.log(
		"üîí EnhancedCoupleSpecificProblemSolution - Using LOCKED stable score:",
		stableScore
	);
	return stableScore;
}
```

## Expected Results

1. **Stable Scores**: Both circles should now show the same score immediately upon loading
2. **No Score Changes**: Once calculated, scores won't fluctuate during the session
3. **Reduced API Calls**: Only one API call per couple analysis session
4. **Better Performance**: Fewer redundant API calls improve loading times
5. **Synchronized Display**: Both compatibility circles maintain visual consistency

## Debugging Information

Added comprehensive logging to track:

- When API calls are made vs. skipped
- Score calculation attempts and results
- Score locking events
- Context data changes

## Testing Instructions

1. Load the couple analysis page
2. Observe that both circles show the same score immediately
3. Check console logs to verify only one API call is made
4. Refresh the page and confirm scores remain consistent
5. Verify no score fluctuations occur during component loading

## Technical Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Score calculation fallback logic remains intact
- Context sharing between components is preserved
- Visual styling changes from previous updates are maintained
